I am a girl!Yes i am a girl!
Does that mean anything to you?
Yes! it means some much to me
Born into societal dilemma of sterotypes suffocating me!

Hey girl you are confined in the kitchen!
Hey girl never should you question decisions of the man
Hey girl you cannot do science courses,go for the arts
Hey this hey that........

I get scared to even say anything in public
Because i am robbed of my self confidence!
I try to raise my hands but i involuntarily withdraw
I cannot maintain eye contact,beacause there is fear burning in my eyes
I am scared that they will laugh at me if i say something wrong

The dilemma is too much!
What do i do?Do i intergrade into the unfairness?
What happens if i question cultures?
Will i be branded disobedient?
Will i be paving ways to embrace the necessary changes?
All these question running in my mind at the speed of sound

No! No!.........
I deserve better
I am going to take my chances
I can sit in the same class with the males
I can learn coding,physics and anything else

I set out to redefine the so called sterotypes
I have rights too
Do not shout me up when i want to say something
You are killing my spirit
Do not throw away the ladder of success
Make it firm so that i can also get up there!
